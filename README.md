## 🚀 Overview
This project combines image segmentation and inpainting techniques to restore or enhance interior design images. It uses a grounded segment anything model to identify different elements within the image and then inpaints missing or damaged portions.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- `models/`: Stores the pre-trained and trained models.
- `src/`: Source code for the project.
- `results/`: Stores inpainted interior design images.
- `docs/`: Additional documentation (if any).

## 🏗️ Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Follow the instructions in the documentation to train the model or use pre-trained models.

## 📂 Data
The `data/` directory contains the dataset used for training and testing. Ensure you have the necessary data before proceeding.

## 🧠 Training
Use the provided scripts to train the grounded segment anything model on your dataset. You can customize hyperparameters and network architecture as needed.

## 🖌️ Inpainting
After segmentation, the inpainting model will fill in missing or damaged parts of interior design images. This step utilizes generative techniques to create realistic content.

## 📊 Evaluation
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, visual quality, and user feedback. Improve the model as necessary.

## 💡 Usage
Provide clear instructions on how to use the inpainting tool. Include examples and a user-friendly interface for uploading images.

## 🤝 Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! Feel free to open issues or submit pull requests.

Happy inpainting! 🎨🏡
