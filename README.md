# Chat-Based Image Inpainting with Grounding DINO, SAM, and Stable Diffusion

## Introduction

This project demonstrates an image inpainting system that leverages the power of Grounding DINO 🦕, Spatially Adaptive Denormalization (SAM 📷), and Stable Diffusion 🌀 to fill in missing or corrupted regions in images using natural language instructions.

## Features

- Image inpainting using advanced techniques:
  - **Grounding DINO**: Understands image content and context.
  - **SAM**: Enhances texture and detail preservation.
  - **Stable Diffusion**: Ensures stable and high-quality results.

- Chat-based interface 🗨️: Input natural language instructions to guide the inpainting process.

- High-quality results 🌟: Generate realistic and context-aware inpainted images.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x 🐍
- PyTorch 🔥
- Transformers (for Grounding DINO) 🤖
- Other project-specific dependencies (check requirements.txt 📋)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-inpainting.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

   ```shell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

1. Run the inpainting application:

   ```shell
   python inpainting_app.py
   ```

2. Access the chat-based interface through your browser at `http://localhost:8080` (or specify a different port).

3. Input a natural language instruction to guide the inpainting process.

4. View and download the inpainted images.
